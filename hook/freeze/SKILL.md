# /freeze — Restrict Edits to a Directory

Lock file edits to a specific directory. Any Edit or Write operation targeting
a file outside the allowed path will be **blocked** (not just warned).

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to:

- Question: "Which directory should I restrict edits to? Files outside this path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
STATE_DIR="${SHIPMATE_DATA:-$HOME/.shipmate}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user: "Edits are now restricted to `<path>/`. Any Edit or Write
outside this directory will be blocked. To change the boundary, run `/freeze`
again. To remove it, run `/unfreeze` or end the session."

## How it works

The hook reads `file_path` from the Edit/Write tool input JSON, then checks
whether the path starts with the freeze directory. If not, it returns
`permissionDecision: "deny"` to block the operation.

## Notes

- The trailing `/` on the freeze directory prevents `/src` from matching `/src-old`
- Freeze applies to Edit and Write tools only — Read, Bash, Glob, Grep are unaffected
- This prevents accidental edits, not a security boundary — Bash commands can still modify files outside
- To deactivate, run `/unfreeze` or end the conversation
